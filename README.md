## 🐝 About PrintHive
=======
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **H2-series and P2S owners — how you send a print decides what gets archived.**
> Bambu Studio's **Print** button sends sliced files to the printer's internal memory, which Bambuddy cannot read — so those prints archive with a name and timing but no thumbnail, filament total or cost. The printer's "Store sent files on external storage" option does not change it (measured on an H2C and an H2D with it enabled); [BambuStudio#10481](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/10481) tracks the default upstream.
> **Start the print from Bambuddy, or slice in OrcaSlicer** — both put the file on the card in one step. Staying in Bambu Studio means using **Send** with **External** picked and starting the print afterwards, because Print itself offers no choice. All of them need a card or stick in the printer; X1 and P1 series are unaffected.

**PrintHive** is a modern, privacy-first, universal 3D printer management platform forked from the upstream [Bambuddy](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy) foundation and radically overhauled to serve as an enterprise-grade print farm command center.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Modern 3D printing is plagued by proprietary walled gardens, vendor-specific slicer locks, and unreliable cloud brokers. PrintHive solves this by presenting a **cohesive, modular abstraction layer**:

1. **Every 3D printer is unified into a standard Feature Pipeline**: Whether telemetry arrives over Bambu MQTT, Elegoo SDCP WebSockets, or Klipper REST, PrintHive normalizes the metrics, job state, file transfer, and controls into a clean interface.
2. **Virtual Printers with Dedicated Multi-Static IPs**: PrintHive acts as a local proxy on your LAN. Slicers (OrcaSlicer, Bambu Studio) discover virtual printers as physical machines, routing slicing jobs directly to automated print queues and physical machines with zero cloud interaction.
3. **Containerized Server-Side Slicing**: Run a full instance of OrcaSlicer directly on your homelab server with hardware memory backing, synced desktop presets, and KasmVNC browser streaming.
4. **Hardened Homelab Deployment**: Automated Proxmox LXC orchestration with 10-year SSL SAN encryption, Tailscale hardware pass-through, and one-click root certificate installation across all clients.

## 🌐 NEW: Remote Printing with Proxy Mode

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/proxy-mode-diagram.png" alt="Proxy Mode Architecture" width="800">
</p>

**Print from anywhere in the world** — Bambuddy's new Proxy Mode acts as a secure relay between your slicer and printer:

- 🔒 **End-to-end TLS encryption** — FTP, file transfer, and camera are transparently proxied with the printer's real TLS certificate
- 🛡️ **Optional Tailscale integration** — per-VP toggle + Docker socket mount surface the host's Tailscale IP on the VP card, so you know which `100.x.x.x` to paste into the slicer when you want a virtual printer reachable over your tailnet ([setup](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/features/virtual-printer/)). Bambuddy's self-signed CA import is still required on the slicer side: Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer validate printer TLS against a bundled BBL CA (not the system trust store), **and** their Add Printer dialog is IP-only (no hostname to match an LE cert against), so a publicly-trusted cert can't help on either dimension. Tailscale's role is the private tunnel (reachability from anywhere, no port forwarding), not cert-import elimination.
- 🌍 **No cloud dependency** — Direct connection through your own Bambuddy server
- 🔑 **Uses printer's access code** — No additional credentials needed
- ⚡ **Full-speed printing** — Transparent TCP proxy, only MQTT is decrypted for IP rewriting

Perfect for remote print farms, traveling makers, or accessing your home printer from work.

👉 **[Setup Guide →](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/features/virtual-printer/#proxy-mode-new-in-017)**

## 🍰 NEW: Integrated Slicing — Slice & Print, All In One Place

**No desktop slicer required.** Drop an STL or 3MF into Bambuddy's File Manager, hit **Slice**, and the result lands as a ready-to-print `.gcode.3mf` in the same folder — without ever opening Bambu Studio or Orca Slicer.

- 🍰 **One-click slicing** — Slice from any browser. The job runs server-side in a [tiny sidecar container](slicer-api/README.md), progress streams back as a toast, and the sliced file appears in your library when it's done.
- 📱 **Slice from your phone or tablet** — Bambuddy's PWA + the new server-side slicer means you can drop an STL in from mobile and queue a print without ever touching a desktop.
- 🎒 **Bring your own profiles** — Import a `Printer Preset Bundle` (`.bbscfg`) exported from Bambu Studio: pick a curated **printer + process + filament** triplet from a dropdown in the Slice dialog, no more juggling JSON files.
- 🔄 **Re-slice for a different printer in one click** — Open any sliced archive in Bambuddy and re-slice it for any printer, including across the single-nozzle ↔ dual-nozzle (H2D / H2D Pro) boundary that BambuStudio's CLI would normally reject. Bambuddy detects the class change and auto-arranges objects laid out for the source bed (e.g. X1C 256×256) so they land safely on the target (e.g. H2D 350×320 with its per-nozzle dead zones).
- 🍱 **Slice all plates at once** — Multi-plate projects (parted statues, multi-part kits) get a "Slice all N plates" toggle in the Slice dialog. One click produces a single `.gcode.3mf` containing every plate's gcode, ready for the printer. The toast shows "Plate 2 of 5 — Generating G-code (47%)" as the loop runs.
- 🔁 **Same dispatch as the rest of Bambuddy** — The sliced output flows into the existing queue / plate-picker / AMS-mapping path, so all the regular conveniences (multi-printer dispatch, AMS routing, scheduled prints) just work.

Optional but recommended — drop the [`slicer-api/` Compose stack](slicer-api/README.md) next to your Bambuddy install and the **Slice** button lights up everywhere.

👉 **[Slicer Integration Guide →](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/features/slicer-api/)**

## 🧩 NEW: Slicer Pipelines — Save a Recipe, Reuse in One Click

**Stop re-picking the same printer + process + filament + bed-type combination every slice.** Save a Slicer **Pipeline** once from the Slice dialog, then apply the whole bundle to any file with a single click — from File Manager, Archives, or MakerWorld imports.

- 🧩 **One-click reuse** — A pipeline captures the entire Slice modal selection (printer + process + per-AMS-slot filaments + bed type) and surfaces as **Run with pipeline → \<name\>** on every sliceable row.
- 🎯 **Specific printer or printer class** — Pin a pipeline to one printer, or to a *class* (e.g. *any X1C*) and let the queue scheduler pick the first available match. Identical-fleet farms get a single recipe instead of one-per-printer.
- 🪢 **Multi-copy fanout** — Slice once, dispatch up to N copies. With class targeting the copies fan out across the matching printers in parallel — **Spread** (fastest wall-clock), **Single printer** (minimise colour-change overhead), or **First N** (one to each).
- 📊 **Runs dashboard** — A new **Pipelines** tab on the Print Queue page lists every run with colour-coded status badges (queued / slicing / dispatching / in-progress / completed / partial-failure / failed / cancelled), per-copy detail on expand, filter dropdowns (Pipeline / Status / Target), and a **Retry failed** button that re-runs only the copies that didn't complete — successful copies are never re-printed.
- 🔒 **Permission-gated** — Three permissions (`pipelines:read` / `pipelines:write` / `pipelines:run`) let you split authoring the recipe from spending filament with it.

## ✨ Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 📦 Print Archive
- Automatic 3MF archiving with metadata
- 3D model preview (Three.js)
- Duplicate detection & full-text search
- Photo attachments & failure analysis
- Timelapse editor (trim, speed, music) with automatic AVI-to-MP4 conversion for P1-series printers, manual upload & remove
- Re-print to any connected printer with AMS mapping (auto-match or manual slot selection, multi-plate support, nozzle-aware matching for dual-nozzle H2D/H2D Pro, **Filament Track Switch (FTS) support** — when the FTS accessory is installed the per-nozzle filter is suppressed since the FTS routes any AMS slot to either extruder)
- Plate thumbnail browsing for multi-plate archives (hover to navigate between plates)
- Archive comparison (side-by-side diff)
- Tag management (rename/delete across all archives)
- **Per-archive print history** — Each archive card shows an `N prints` badge whenever a model has been printed more than once (reprint + failed retries all counted). Click the badge for the full per-archive Print Log — every individual run with date, status, duration, filament used, cost, and failure reason. Reprints contribute new rows so a failed retry never overwrites the source archive's data — the original 100 g successful print stays visible alongside the 10 g failed reprint, and Quick Stats add up to 110 g across both events.
- **Print Log** — Chronological table view of all print activity with columns for date/time, print name, printer, user, status, duration, and filament. Filterable by search, printer, user, status, and date range. Pagination with configurable page size. Clear button removes log entries without affecting archives.

### 📊 Monitoring & Control
- Real-time printer status via WebSocket
- **Print progress in the browser tab** — optional (off by default, toggle under Settings → Appearance): shows the soonest-finishing print's percentage in the tab title and a progress-ring favicon in your theme accent colour
- Live camera streaming (MJPEG) & snapshots with multi-viewer support — most Bambu printers only allow one upstream connection, so Bambuddy fans out a single shared stream to all browser tabs / cards / overlays
- **Cam Wall view** — Toggle the Printers page from cards into a responsive grid of camera tiles for at-a-glance monitoring across the whole farm. On-screen tiles stream live up to a configurable cap (default 4) so RPi installs stay sustainable; the rest fall back to periodic snapshot polling, and off-screen tiles pause entirely. Per-user settings (live cap, snapshot interval); click any tile to open the floating viewer or the dedicated camera window depending on your existing camera-view preference
- **Long-lived camera tokens** for Home Assistant / Frigate / kiosks — mint a token from Settings → API Keys, paste it once, capped at 365 days, revocable at any time (no infinite tokens — leaked permanent tokens are unsafe by design)
- **Streaming overlay for OBS** - Embeddable page with camera + status for live streaming (`/overlay/:printerId`), configurable FPS (`?fps=30`), status-only mode (`?camera=false`)
- External camera support (MJPEG, RTSP, HTTP snapshot, USB/V4L2) with layer-based timelapse
- **Build plate empty detection** - Auto-pause print if objects detected on plate (multi-reference calibration, ROI adjustment)
- Fan monitoring and **speed control** for part-cooling, auxiliary, and chamber fans (0–100% with customizable quick-select presets)
- Printer control (stop, pause, resume, chamber light, print speed, **airduct mode** for P2S/H2*, **temperature setpoints** for nozzle / bed / **chamber heater** on H2C/H2D/H2DPro/H2S/X2D, **Z-jog / XY-jog / extruder jog**, customizable temperature & fan presets under Settings → Workflow)
- **Status badges on printer card**: SD Card (green / red), Enclosure Door (green / yellow — X1/P1S/P2S/H2*), Airduct Mode (cooling / heating)
- **Force Refresh** menu item — request a full status push from the printer without reconnecting
- **Maintenance Mode** — put a printer "out of service" without removing it. Toggle from the card's three-dot menu, the in-card amber banner, or the Edit Printer dialog; the printer disconnects MQTT, drops out of queue dispatch, the scheduler, model-based filament lookups, metrics, and notifications until you take it out again. The card stays visible (amber wrench banner + Exit button) so the printer never disappears from your dashboard. Useful for parallel Bambuddy installs sharing the same hardware, printers under repair or awaiting parts, and temporary suspension.
- Bulk printer actions (multi-select cards, then stop/pause/resume/clear all — select by state or location)
- Printer search and filters — live search by name/model/location/serial plus status and location dropdown filters (WebSocket-reactive, mobile-friendly)
- Resizable printer cards (S/M/L/XL)
- Skip objects during print
- AMS slot RFID re-read
- **AMS slot Load / Unload from the printer card** — Hover any AMS slot or external spool, click the menu button, and load that tray or unload the currently-loaded one without going to the touchscreen; supports dual-extruder H2D (Ext-L / Ext-R drive their own nozzle)
- **AMS Filament Backup status + control with pair view** — Mirrors BambuStudio's per-printer "AMS Filament Backup" auto-switch (when a spool runs out, the printer rolls over to a same-preset, same-colour spool in another slot). A small badge in the Filaments section header on each printer card shows the live state (blue circular-arrow icon = ON, dim = OFF, "?" = A1 family with no `cfg` field yet); click to open the AMS Filament Backup modal — a BambuStudio Auto Refill-style ring graphic per backup pair, with the filament colour as the ring fill and member slot labels (e.g. `A·1`, `B·3`) on contrast-aware pills around the band. Dual-extruder printers (H2D / H2C / X2D) carry an `R` / `L` badge per ring because the firmware can't cross extruders. State syncs in real time whether you toggled from Bambuddy, BambuStudio, or the printer's touchscreen. Bambuddy's "insufficient filament" check is **backup-aware**: when Backup is ON, the deficit check pools remaining grams across same-`(preset, colour)` spools on the printer, so the warning doesn't fire spuriously when the firmware will swap to a peer mid-print (#1762). Bambuddy's **Prefer Lowest Remaining Filament** sort also respects the toggle — when Backup is OFF the dispatcher skips the prefer-lowest sort entirely so it won't reach for a near-empty spool the printer can't roll off of.
- AMS slot configuration (model-filtered presets, K profiles, color picker, pre-population for configured slots)
- AMS info card (hover for serial number, firmware version) with custom friendly names that persist across printers
- **AMS remote drying** — Start, monitor, and stop drying sessions for AMS 2 Pro and AMS-HT directly from the Printers page with filament-based temperature/duration presets, optional spool rotation; automatic PSU detection and HMS power error reporting. Rotate-spool toggle is disabled per-AMS when any tray has filament threaded into the feed tube (the AMS mechanism is locked there — rotating would jam the filament)
- **Queue auto-drying** — Automatically dry filament between scheduled prints when humidity exceeds threshold; configurable presets per filament type, optional blocking mode
- **Ambient drying** — Automatically keep filament dry on idle printers based on humidity, regardless of whether prints are queued
- **Continue drying while printing** — On capable hardware (H2D 01.03.00.00+, H2C / H2S / P2S / H2D Pro 01.02.00.00+, X2D / A2L 01.01.00.00+, X1C 01.11.02.00+), auto-drying can keep running during a print. Default off, opt-in toggle in Settings → Print Queue. Drying temperature is automatically capped 5°C below the idle preset (floor 40°C) to protect spools inside the hot enclosure
- Configurable drying presets per filament type (temperature & duration for AMS 2 Pro and AMS-HT)
- **Per-filament humidity threshold** — Set a different humidity trigger per filament type (e.g. Nylon at 20%, PLA at 60%, ASA at 30%) instead of one global value. Mixed-material AMS units use the most-restrictive threshold across the loaded spools so a single PLA + Nylon unit triggers at Nylon's level. Drives both the auto-drying scheduler and the hourly humidity alarm so the two can never disagree on whether a unit is "too humid"
- Dual external spool support for H2D (Ext-L / Ext-R)
- **HMS error monitoring with one-click actions** — Live HMS error log with history and the same Resume / Stop / Continue / Retry / Check Assistant / Don't Remind Me action buttons BambuStudio shows. Click and the matching MQTT command goes back to the printer — no more walking to the device just to dismiss a paused-print dialog. Catalog covers every Bambu model (X1 / P1 / A1 / H2 series); buttons are translated in all 13 supported locales
- **Heater history charts** — Bambuddy logs nozzle, bed, and chamber readings every minute and surfaces them via a tiny chart icon on each heater tile in the printer card. Click for a per-heater modal with current / average / min / max stats, target overlay, and a 6h / 24h / 48h / 7d time range — works on read-only chamber sensors (X1C / P2S) too. AMS humidity and temperature get the same treatment (already shipped).
- Print success rates & trends
- Filament usage tracking
- Cost analytics & failure analysis
- **AI print-failure detection** — Optional integration with a self-hosted [Obico](https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/obico-server) ML API: watches each running print's camera feed, smooths scores over time (30-frame warmup + EWM + rolling means), and fires a configurable action once per print (notify / pause / pause-and-off)
- Per-user statistics filtering (admin permission gated)
- CSV/Excel export

### ⏰ Scheduling & Automation
- **Unified dispatch through the queue** — Every print Bambuddy starts (File Manager, archive reprint, printer-card upload-and-print, scheduled queue items) flows through the same queue scheduler, so each print is visible on the queue page, attributable to the user that started it, deficit-checked, and cancellable from one place. FTP uploads and print-start commands run in the background with real-time WebSocket progress toasts (per-job upload bars, status badges, cancel button). Installations with custom groups or API keys: the immediate-print actions now require the `queue:create` permission alongside the existing `printers:control` — see [the permissions guide](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/admin/permissions/) if you've granted control without queue-create
- Print queue with three tabs (Queue / History / Timeline), multi-select drag-and-drop, batch grouping, and a Gantt-style timeline
- Multi-printer selection (send to multiple printers at once)
- Batch grouping — multi-plate prints auto-group into a collapsible row; any 2+ selected items can be grouped manually via "Group as batch", with ungroup on the batch parent
- Batch print quantity (print multiple copies — set quantity in the print/schedule dialog, first copy prints immediately, rest are queued)
- Staggered batch start (start printers in groups with configurable interval to avoid power spikes — works in both Print and Queue dialogs)
- Configurable default print options (bed levelling, flow/vibration calibration, first layer inspection, timelapse) in Settings → Workflow
- Model-based queue assignment (send to "any X1C" for load balancing) with location filtering
- Filament override for model-based queue (swap filament colors/types before scheduling)
- Filament validation (only assign to printers with required filaments)
- Prefer lowest remaining filament (consume partial spools first when multiple match)
- Per-printer AMS mapping (individual slot configuration for print farms)
- Scheduled prints (date/time)
- Shortest Job First scheduling (SJF toggle on queue page — scheduler picks shorter prints first, with starvation guard)
- Queue Only mode (stage without auto-start)
- Clear plate confirmation between queued prints (can be disabled in settings for farm workflows)
- Auto-print G-code injection (per-model start/end snippets for Farmloop, SwapMod, AutoClear, Printflow 3D — toggle per queue item)
- **Preheat & Heat Soak before queued prints** — Heat the bed (and the chamber, on supported printers) and hold at temperature between FTP upload and print start. Per-print Inherit / On / Off override in the Print Options panel; per-filament chamber-target map under Settings → Workflow so PA wants 50°C, ABS 45°C, PETG-CF 40°C, PLA 0°C (skips chamber phase automatically). Hardware-aware: H-series / X2D / X1E actively heat the chamber via M141; X1C / P2S rely on bed radiation with a chamber-sensor wait; P1S / P1P / A1 family have no chamber sensor so only the soak timer applies. The cooling/heating airduct flap on H-series / X2D / P2S auto-switches to match the resolved chamber target — preheat for ABS opens nothing and recirculates warm air; preheat for PLA opens the exhaust and vents — so engineering filaments actually reach target instead of fighting the open flap, and PLA prints don't inherit a previously-hot recirculation. M191 (wait-for-chamber-temp) isn't honoured by Bambu firmware, so doing this at the orchestration layer is the only place it works
- Smart plug integration (Tasmota, Home Assistant, MQTT, REST/Webhook)
- REST smart plugs: Control any device with an HTTP API (openHAB, ioBroker, FHEM, Node-RED) with separate power/energy URLs and unit multipliers
- MQTT smart plugs: Subscribe to Zigbee2MQTT, Shelly, or any MQTT topic for energy monitoring
- Energy consumption tracking (per-print kWh and cost) — restart-resilient: mid-print backend restarts no longer lose per-print energy
- Energy statistics by date range (Today / Week / Month / …) in total-consumption mode via hourly lifetime-counter snapshots
- HA energy sensor support (for plugs with separate power/energy sensors)
- Auto power-on before print
- Auto power-off after cooldown

### 📁 File Manager (Library)
- Upload and organize sliced files (3MF, gcode, STL)
- **External folder mounting** - Mount host directories (NAS, USB, network shares) without copying files. Operator-controlled via the `BAMBUDDY_EXTERNAL_ROOTS` env var (colon-separated allowlist of host paths users are permitted to register; empty by default to disable the feature). See [Docker → External library folders](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/getting-started/docker/#external-library-folders-bambuddy_external_roots).
- **STL thumbnail generation** - Auto-generate previews for STL files on upload or batch generate for existing files
- ZIP file extraction with folder structure preservation
- Option to create folder from ZIP filename
- Folder structure with drag-and-drop
- Rename files and folders via context menu
- Print directly to any printer with full options
- Add to queue without creating archive upfront
- Plate selection for multi-plate 3MF files
- Duplicate detection via file hash
- Mobile-friendly with always-visible action buttons
- **Server-side Slice button** (optional) — slice STL/3MF without a desktop slicer when the [`slicer-api/` Compose stack](slicer-api/README.md) is running; the result lands as a new `.gcode.3mf` in the same folder, with progress shown via a toast tracker that follows the job to completion. Supports importing **Bambu Studio Printer Preset Bundles** (`.bbscfg`) so a curated printer + process + filament triplet can be picked in the Slice dialog without re-uploading JSON profiles ([details](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/features/slicer-api/#slicer-bundles-bbscfg))

### 🌍 MakerWorld Integration
- Paste any `makerworld.com/models/…` URL → preview, plate picker, and import without leaving Bambuddy
- Per-plate **Save** or **Save & Slice in Bambu Studio / OrcaSlicer** (your preferred slicer from Settings)
- **Import all plates** button for multi-plate models
- Auto-creates a "MakerWorld" folder in File Manager; override with any existing folder via the picker
- Per-plate image gallery with keyboard-navigable lightbox
- Recent imports sidebar — last 10 MakerWorld imports with one-click jump to File Manager or slicer
- Remove-from-library for imported plates with confirm modal (no LAN cookie paste, no browser extension)
- Reuses your existing Bambu Cloud login — no separate OAuth flow or browser extension to install

### 📁 Projects
- Group related prints (e.g., "Voron Build")
- Track plates (print jobs) and parts separately
- Auto-detect parts count from 3MF files
- Color-coded project badges
- **Project URL + cover photo** — paste a MakerWorld/Printables/Thingiverse link and upload a hero image so each card is immediately recognisable; the URL renders as a one-click link beside the project name
- Bulk assign archives via multi-select toolbar
- Import/Export projects as ZIP (includes files) or JSON
- Print or queue files from linked library folders directly in the project view (resulting archive auto-linked to the project)

### 🔔 Notifications
- WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord
- Email, Pushover, ntfy (with per-event priority — Min / Low / Default / High / Urgent)
- Home Assistant persistent notifications
- Custom webhooks
- Quiet hours & daily digest
- Customizable message templates with per-filament usage details
- Print finish photo URL in notifications
- Filament usage and progress in failed/cancelled print notifications
- **Missing spool assignment warning** — Toast and push notification when a print starts with unassigned AMS trays
- HMS error alerts (AMS, nozzle, etc.)
- Build plate detection alerts
- First layer complete alert (with camera snapshot)
- Bed cooled alerts (configurable threshold)
- Queue events (waiting, skipped, failed)

### 🧵 Spool Inventory
- Built-in spool inventory with AMS slot assignment, usage tracking, and remaining weight management
- Automatic filament consumption tracking: 3MF slicer estimates for all spools (primary), AMS remain% delta as fallback
- Mid-print spool reassignment support: uses live assignment if changed during print, snapshot otherwise
- Per-layer gcode accuracy for partial prints (failed/cancelled), with linear scaling fallback
- **Per-spool cost tracking** — Set cost/kg on each spool; costs are automatically calculated at print completion and aggregated to archives. Print modal shows real-time cost preview. Configurable default cost and currency in Settings.
- **Bulk spool addition** — Add multiple identical spools at once (quantity 1–100) with a single form submission. Quick Add mode for stock spools that only need material, color, and weight.
- Spool catalog, color catalog, PA profile matching, and low-stock alerts
- **Multi-colour gradients, transparency, and visual effects** — Paste a comma-separated hex list (e.g. from 3dfilamentprofiles.com) to render a spool as a gradient or conic colour wheel; transparency shows through a checkerboard so the alpha you set is the alpha you see; pick a visual effect (sparkle, wood, marble, glow, matte) for the swatch overlay. Same fields are editable on the colour catalog so combos can be reused across spools.
- **Printable spool labels** — Generate PDF labels for any selection of spools in four pre-built sizes: AMS holder (30×15 mm), box label (62×29 mm), Avery L7160 sheet (A4, 21 per page), and Avery 5160 sheet (US Letter, 30 per page). Each label shows the colour swatch, brand, material, name, the **spool ID** (for at-a-glance identification across many similar spools), and a QR code that deep-links straight back to the spool's row in Bambuddy when scanned with a phone. Pick from the inventory page — search, filter by material, multi-select spools, then print or save to PDF. For a partially used Avery sheet, choose the first unused label position; Bambuddy leaves the earlier positions blank and starts later pages from position 1.

### 🔧 Integrations

### 🖨️ Virtual Printer & Remote Printing
- **🌐 Proxy Mode** — Print remotely from anywhere via secure TLS relay
- **🪞 Live target-printer mirror in non-proxy modes (NEW!)** — Immediate / Review / Queue VPs now mirror their target printer's live state to the slicer: AMS slot contents, FTS / dual-extruder routing, k-profiles, AMS load / dry / calibration commands, and the camera stream all flow through the VP. Use the slicer as a full remote for the printer behind the VP without giving up Bambuddy's queue / archive / dispatch features.
- Emulates a Bambu Lab printer on your network
- Send prints directly from Bambu Studio/Orca Slicer
- Configurable printer model (X1C, P1S, A1, H2D, etc.)
- Archive mode, Review mode, Queue mode, or Proxy mode
- Queue mode: optional **force-color-match** so the scheduler refuses to dispatch onto a printer with the wrong filament loaded

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (3.11/3.12 recommended)
- Bambu Lab printer with **Developer Mode** enabled (see below)
- **"Store sent files on external storage"** enabled in Bambu Studio/OrcaSlicer
- Same local network as printer

### Installation

#### Windows (Native Installer)

Self-contained `.exe` — no Python, Node, Docker, or Git required on the target machine. The installer bundles Python 3.13, the React frontend, ffmpeg, and registers Bambuddy as a Windows service.

Download the latest installer:

> https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/releases/latest/download/bambuddy-windows-x64-setup.exe

Run it (one-time UAC prompt — admin install) → Bambuddy starts as a Windows service and the dashboard opens at **http://localhost:8000** automatically. Data lives at `C:\ProgramData\Bambuddy\`, install at `C:\Program Files\Bambuddy\`. To update, just run a newer installer over the existing install — your database and archives are preserved.

> **SmartScreen warning:** until our SignPath OSS code-signing approval lands, you'll see "Windows protected your PC" on first run. Click **More info → Run anyway**.

See the [Windows Installer Guide](https://wiki.bambuddy.cool/getting-started/windows-installer/) for service management, logs, and troubleshooting.

#### Docker (Linux / macOS / Windows via Docker Desktop)

**Option A: Pre-built image (fastest)**
```bash
mkdir bambuddy && cd bambuddy
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maziggy/bambuddy/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
>>>>>>> upstream/main
```

### 1. Modular Printer Pipeline (`PrinterPipeline`)
Printers are no longer hardcoded into disparate services. Instead, each manufacturer implements a standardized `IPrinterAdapter`:
* **Telemetry**: Unified temperature, fan, chamber, nozzle, and layer stats.
* **Job Control**: Universal `start_print`, `pause`, `resume`, and `cancel` verbs.
* **File Upload**: Direct FTPS (Bambu) or multi-chunk tokenized HTTP uploads (Elegoo).
* **Live Camera**: Chamber RTSP and MJPEG broadcast streaming.

### 2. Multi-IP Virtual Printer Network
To eliminate port collisions on standard ports (Port 990 for FTPS, Port 8883 for MQTT, Port 3030 for SDCP, Port 1900/2021 for SSDP), each virtual printer binds to its own dedicated static IP interface on the local subnet (`vmbr0`). Your local router/gateway (e.g., Google Fiber `192.168.1.1`) sees them as separate physical devices.

### 3. Containerized OrcaSlicer (KasmVNC & Drag-and-Drop Auto-Load)
OrcaSlicer runs natively inside the stack (`lscr.io/linuxserver/orcaslicer`) with 2GB shared memory (`/dev/shm`), dark mode enabled by default, and a built-in drag-and-drop watcher:
* **Drag-and-Drop File Loading**: Drag any `.3mf`, `.stl`, `.step`, or `.obj` file directly from your desktop into the browser window — the integrated `orca_drop_watcher` daemon detects the upload and opens it on the build plate automatically.
* **Direct Print Archive Access**: Mounts PrintHive's data archive directly into `/prints/archive` so you can open historical prints with `Ctrl+O` without re-uploading.
* **Synced Slicing Presets**: Custom filament profiles, printer settings, and process parameters from your desktop are synchronized automatically.

### 4. Nginx Reverse Proxy & SSL Termination
* **Automatic Redirect**: Port 80 redirects to HTTPS on Port 443.
* **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)**: 10-year TLS 1.2/1.3 certificate covers `printhive.local.home`, `orcaslicer.local.home`, `*.local.home`, LAN IPs, and Tailscale endpoints.
* **Universal Cert Distribution**: Nginx exposes `/cert` and `/printhive.crt` over plain HTTP so mobile phones and laptops can download the root certificate before completing an SSL handshake.
